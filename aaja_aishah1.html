            <h2>A little known rule</h2>
            <blockquote>
              <p>“There is a general sense of hopelessness of never being legally recognised as their authentic selves, especially given the hoops they will have to jump through just to have a chance at having their gender marker changed” – Alexander Teh, a transgender man and Youth Worker from Oogachaga (LGBTQ+ NGO)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In Singapore, a little known rule profoundly shapes the lives of hundreds of people, including my own. Known by some as the legal gender recognition (LGR) rule, it’s an administrative rule governing  how one’s gender marker can be changed from “F” to “M” or vice versa on legal documents like the NRIC or passport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, a person had to undergo “a sex change procedure” and provide a letter from the surgeon confirming it’d been done. But, in 2017, the rule changed without prior consultation or warning, says Chris Khor, one of the authors of the community survey. Now, a trans person’s genitalia must have been “completely changed from male/female to female/male genitalia”, and be confirmed by an genital examination by another doctor. It’s unclear why the rules changed, but the effect is that someone wishing to change their gender marker must undergo more surgeries and an additional potentially invasive process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people, even within the LGBTQ+ community, are unaware of this rule and its associated challenges. Leow Yangfa, Oogachaga’s Director, shares that some think “since post-surgery LGR is possible, so what’s the problem [for trans people]?” But many don’t understand “not every trans person is able or willing to access surgery”.
            </p>
            <p>
              For one, it can be eye-wateringly expensive. Most of the surgeries aren’t even possible in Singapore and aren’t covered by insurance plans. Perhaps contrary to popular belief, there isn’t just one sex change surgery—multiple surgeries exist. For transmen, a so-called “complete” genitalia change might require around 5 distinct types of surgeries—one can cost $100,000 plus—whereas previously just one was needed.
